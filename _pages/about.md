I am a PhD student in Political Economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I work on political methodology and American politics, focusing on local and historical political economy. 

Previously, I graduated University College London with a degree in Economics and was a predoctoral fellow research fellow with the Political Economics group here at the GSB.
