![headline-image](/images/positive_political_economy.jpeg)

I am a PhD student in Political Economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I study political methodology and American politics, focusing on causal inference and local political economy. 

My work attempts to understand how economic forces facing municipal and other local governments shape the choices of politicians and potential candidates. My methodological work designs new tools for observational causal inference. 

I am advised by Greg Martin, Yiqing Xu, Andy Hall, Jonathan Rodden, and Guido Imbens.

My methodological work 

I apply these tools alongside the collection of novel datasets, both from combination of administrative sources and archival shoeleather. I am most excited by projects that allow us to measure opaque aspects of politics such as wealth and corruption.  

To shed light on this topic, I integrate formal models of spatial equilibrium and political economy; collect novel data, both from shoeleather and by processing unstructured data with machine learning algorithms; and test impliciations of models with observational quasi-experiments.
